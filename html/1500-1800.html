				<h3>What is music therapy?</h3>
				<p>
					Music therapy is the use of music and/or elements of music
					(like sound, rhythm and harmony) to accomplish goals, like
					reducing stress or improving quality of life. A healthcare
					provider called a music therapist talks to you to learn more
					about your needs, music preferences and experiences, and
					designs each session specifically for you. They also
					evaluate your progress each step of the way, and may work
					with your other healthcare providers to coordinate your
					care. The number of sessions you have, the length of each
					session and what you do depends on your individual needs and
					goals. Music therapy experiences may include singing,
					playing instruments or writing music. Some sessions may
					involve listening to music and talking about its meaning.
					Healthcare providers use music as therapy in many contexts,
					including at the bedside for people in hospitals. However,
					music therapy isn’t the same as listening to music to help
					you relax. Music can certainly be a powerful tool for
					calming and healing. But the definition of clinical musical
					therapy states that a qualified music therapist must plan
					and lead the session within a therapeutic relationship for
					it to qualify as this form of treatment.Music therapy helps
					people of all ages (children, adolescents and adults) and
					from all walks of life. It may benefit many different
					aspects of your well-being, including:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mental</li>
					<li>Emotional</li>
					<li>Physical</li>
					<li>Social</li>
					<li>Cognitive</li>

				</h2>

				<p>
					Music therapists use this form of treatment to manage a vast
					range of conditions. It’s typically a complementary therapy.
					This means it’s part of a larger treatment plan that may
					include medications or other interventions. Research shows
					music therapy can offer benefits to people with:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Dementia</li>
					<li>Traumatic brain injuries</li>
					<li>Stroke</li>
					<li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
					<li>Cancer</li>
					<li>Autism spectrum disorder</li>
					<li>Mood disorders</li>
					<li>Learning disabilities</li>

				<p>
					Music therapy is a healthcare profession in which a
					qualified music therapist designs your sessions with
					specific, individualized goals in mind. Therapeutic music is
					a method for relaxing you or lifting your emotions in times
					of need. It doesn’t require a music therapist and can
					involve a range of experiences. This can be as simple as
					listening to calming music through headphones. Music can
					positively influence your emotions wherever you hear it,
					including in hospitals or schools. This is why some
					healthcare professionals, like nurses, play music at the
					bedside to help people who are recovering or in pain. But
					these experiences aren’t the same as music therapy, in which
					a music therapist designs a treatment plan for you and
					guides each session. A music therapist can help you
					understand more about the unique aspects of music therapy
					and how it may benefit you. They can also explain how you
					may use music in your daily life, outside of your sessions,
					to enjoy other benefits.

					possibilities of music in a clinical context. Together with
					your music therapist, you’ll set goals and work toward
					achieving them. Your therapist will talk with you each step
					of the way to see how you’re feeling. They’ll design each
					session just for you and continue to adapt sessions to your
					evolving interests and needs. It’s important to keep in mind
					that music therapy isn’t just for children. Adults of all
					ages can also benefit. If you’re interested in music therapy
					for your child, talk to your pediatrician about how you can
					connect with a music therapist to learn more.
