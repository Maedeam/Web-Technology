			​The use of music to soothe grief has been used since the time of
			David and King Saul. In I Samuel, David plays the lyre to make King
			Saul feel relieved and better.​Music therapy practice is working
			together with clients, through music, to promote healthy change
			(Bruscia, 1998). The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) has
			defined the practice of music therapy as
			<q>
				a behavioral science concerned with changing unhealthy behaviors
				and replacing them with more adaptive ones through the use of
				musical stimuli.
			</q>
			​ Music has been used as a healing implement for
			centuries. Apollo is the ancient Greek god of music and of medicine
			and his son Aesculapius was said to cure diseases of the mind by
			using song and music. By 5000 BC, music was used for healing by
			Egyptian priest-physicians.​From a western viewpoint, music therapy
			in the 20th and 21st centuries (as of 2021), as an evidence-based,
			allied healthcare profession, grew out of the aftermath of World
			Wars I and II. Particularly in the United Kingdom and United States,
			musicians would travel to hospitals and play music for soldiers with
			war-related emotional and physical trauma.
		</p>
		<p class="element">
			​Two fundamental types of music therapy are receptive music therapy
			and active music therapy (also known as expressive music therapy).
			Active music therapy engages clients or patients in the act of
			making music, whereas receptive music therapy guides patients or
			clients in listening or responding to live or recorded music. Either
			or both can lead to verbal discussions, depending on client needs
			and the therapist's orientation.​Music therapist Kenneth Bruscia
			stated
			<q>
				A model is a comprehensive approach to assessment, treatment,
				and evaluation that includes theoretical principles, clinical
				indications and contraindications, goals, methodological
				guidelines and specifications, and the characteristic use of
				certain procedural sequences and techniques.
			</q>
			 In the literature, the terms model, orientation, or approach might
			be encountered and may have slightly different meanings. Regardless,
			music therapists use both psychology models and models specific to
			music therapy. The theories these models are based on include
			beliefs about human needs, causes of distress, and how humans grow
			or heal.

			Over the past year, we have focused on how to improve journal
			operations in our limited roles as interim co-editors. For example,
			we supported an initiative centered on improving the diversity of
			authors. Oxford University Press joined an endeavor led by Clarivate
			and the Joint Commitment for Action on Inclusion and Diversity in
			Publishing to promote diversity of authors in academic publishing.
			One of the first steps being taken is to establish industry
			benchmarks by measuring the current diversity of authors in academic
			journals. As of December 1, 2022, all individuals who log in to our
			online submission system are invited to provide information
			regarding their gender, ethnicity, and race. These data will be
			collected anonymously, will not be tied to an individual’s account,
			and users can opt out of answering any of the questions. Our hope is
			that the aggregated data from this tool will help inform us about
			current representation in the JMT, so that we may work to support
			better representation and diversity moving forward.

			This year marks the 60th year, or Diamond Jubilee, of the Journal of
			Music Therapy (JMT). To commemorate this event the coeditors have
			asked that I write an editorial that provides a brief overview of
			the historical events related to the creation and publication of the
			Journal. As a start, I want to give the reader more clarity about my
			own identity and experiences with this journal. It is now 20 years
			since I began my undergraduate studies in music therapy. As a white,
			cisgender, middle-class student at the turn of the 21st century, I
			studied with past archivist Dr. Bill Davis at Colorado State
			University where the archives for the American Music Therapy
			Association (AMTA) are kept. I developed a growing interest in the
			history of music therapy as a graduate student at The University of
			Iowa, an interest that continued when I returned to Colorado State
			University as faculty. Together these experiences led me on a path
			to be the archivist for the AMTA. More specific to the journals I
			have served as a guest peer reviewer for the JMT and currently serve
			on the editorial board of Music Therapy Perspectives.
