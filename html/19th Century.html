			​​In the 19th century, music therapy as a formal practice had not
			yet emerged in America. However, music played a significant role in
			the lives of people during this time, and its therapeutic effects
			were recognized and utilized in various ways.In the context of
			mental health, music was often employed in asylums and hospitals to
			create a soothing environment and promote emotional well-being.
			Patients were often encouraged to participate in musical activities,
			such as singing, playing instruments, and attending musical
			performances. These activities were believed to have a calming and
			uplifting effect on individuals struggling with mental illnesses.
			​music was also used as a form of entertainment and social bonding
			in communities across America. People gathered for concerts, dances,
			and other musical events, which provided an opportunity for
			individuals to connect, express themselves, and experience a sense
			of joy and togetherness.Religious gatherings and church services
			were another avenue through which music had a therapeutic influence.
			Hymns and spiritual songs were sung to uplift the spirits of
			congregants, create a sense of unity, and provide solace during
			challenging times.Moreover, music played a role in the education
			system, particularly in the teaching of children. Singing and
			learning songs were seen as beneficial for children's cognitive
			development, memory retention, and emotional expression.While the
			term "music therapy" did not exist in the 19th century, these
			various uses of music highlight its therapeutic potential in
			promoting emotional well-being, fostering social connections, and

			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<p id="spec">
				The history of music therapy in the United States has not been
				thoroughly investigated and documented. The few sources
				containing information on the historical uses of music in
				medicine concentrate primarily on 20th century practices, while
				virtually omitting 19th century contributions to the field. The
				purpose of this study was to analyze elected music therapy
				literature that appeared in 19th century medical journals and
				dissertations. The articles found in these publications
				indicated interest during this time in advocating the use of
				music to provide the patient an alternate, more holistic
				approach to treatment. The dissemination of music therapy ideas
				occurred almost exclusively through these publications, which
				unfortunately resulted in very limited proliferation of the
				topic because of the nature of the audience (i.e.,primarily
				physicians). Nine articles were analyzed; the study was based on
				primary evidence located in medical journals and dissertations
				written between 1804 and 1899. The sources were located in a
				variety of bibliographies found in books, journals,
				dissertations, and theses.

				​Effects of Music Therapy on Patients with Dementia-A Systematic
				Review
			</h4>
			<p id="speci">
				​Dementia is an increasingly common syndrome and while
				pharmacotherapy is available, its potential benefit is limited,
				especially in non-cognitive outcomes. Non-pharmacotherapy such
				as music therapy is potentially associated with improved
				outcomes. We assessed the effects of music therapy on patients
				with dementia to evaluate its potential benefits on dementia.
				Two independent reviewers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL,
				CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for clinical trials,
				using the keywords "music therapy" and "dementia". Study
				outcomes included cognitive function, behavioral and
				psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and quality of life.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h5>Effects of music therapy</h5>
			<p id="specia">
				Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are
				common problems for patients and caregivers. Although music
				therapy is considered a non-pharmacological intervention for the
				management of BPSD, its effectiveness remains unclear. This
				study aimed to investigate the effects of music therapy on BPSD,
				cognitive function, and activities of daily living in patients
				with dementia. A literature search was conducted in the
				following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Igaku Chuo
				Zasshi. We selected 20 studies, including randomized controlled
				trials, controlled clinical trials, cohort studies, and
				controlled trials, and conducted a meta-analysis using
				standardized mean differences (SMD).

					The latter 19th century saw the development of modern music
					psychology alongside the emergence of a general empirical
					psychology, one which passed through similar stages of
					development. The first was structuralist psychology, led by
					Wilhelm Wundt, which sought to break down experience into
					its smallest definable parts. This expanded upon previous
					centuries of acoustic study, and included Helmholtz
					developing the resonator to isolate and understand pure and
					complex tones and their perception, the philosopher Carl
					Stumpf using church organs and his own musical experience to
					explore timbre and absolute pitch, and Wundt himself
					associating the experience of rhythm with kinesthetic
					tension and relaxation. As structuralism gave way to Gestalt
					psychology and behaviorism at the turn of the century, music
					psychology moved beyond the study of isolated tones and
					elements to the perception of their inter-relationships and
					human reactions to them, though work languished behind that
					of visual perception. In Europe Géza Révész and Albert
					Wellek developed a more complex understanding of musical
					pitch, and in the US the focus shifted to that of music
					education and the training and development of musical skill.
					Carl Seashore led this work, producing his The Measurement
					of Musical Talents and The Psychology of Musical Talent.
					Seashore used bespoke equipment and standardized tests to
					measure how performance deviated from indicated markings and
					how musical aptitude differed between students. In 1963 F.
					Chrysler was the first one to use the term
					<q>science of music</q>
					when he was working on his
					<q>year book for musical knowledge</q>
					. European musicology was found in Greek. They were focused
					on the philosophy, and the concepts of any relations with
					music. Greek's several theories rose later to Arab and the
					Christians theories. Although their theories survived, they
					were also corrupted along the way, in the Middle Ages of
					Europe.

					This article outlines the historical evolution and
					precursors of modern music therapy in Vienna from c. 1820 to
					1960. The first section describes early attempts to
					purposefully integrate music into Viennese psychiatry and
					highlights the groundbreaking work of Bruno Goergen
					(1777–1842), who around the year 1820 deliberately
					incorporated music into psychiatric institutions based on
					his dedication to the ideals of
					<q>moral treatment</q>
					and
					<q>no-restraint</q>
					>psychiatry. Shortly thereafter, the first medical
					dissertations on the therapeutic effect of music began to be
					published in Vienna. Around 1850, the emergence of an
					<q>active</q>
					form of
					<q>music therapy</q>
					(in the broadest sense) is recognizable; during the same
					time period, physicians began taking their patients’ musical
					preferences, education, and disposition into account.
					However, as university medicine became firmly rooted in the
					standards of experimental science, physicians increasingly
					lost their interest in music. The second section gives an
					overview of several cultural movements that emerged in the
					first half of the twentieth century and inspired the
					pioneers of music therapy in Vienna, paving the way for the
					foundation of modern Viennese music therapy in 1958. Among
					these were the life reform movement, the curative rhythm and
					dance movement, and anthroposophy, as well as psychotherapy
					and progressive music-educational concepts. At the
					conclusion of this article, the main traits of the history
					of music therapy in Vienna and some of the pervading
					premises of Viennese music therapy are summarized.

			<h3>What is art therapy?</h3>
			<p id="spec2">
				Art therapy is a technique that uses artistic methods to improve
				a person’s mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing. People
				have been using art to express themselves for centuries, but it
				was first documented as a therapeutic tool to promote healing in
				the 1940s. The goal of art therapy is to encourage people to
				open up and engage with their therapist in a less conventional
				way. By using art as a form of expression, some people may feel
				more comfortable exploring emotions, managing behaviors, and
				reconciling conflicts—all of which can reduce stress and boost
				self-esteem. Today, art therapy comes in many forms. Some of the
				most common types are:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Collaging</li>
				<li>Coloring</li>
				<li>Doodling</li>
				<li>Drawing</li>
				<li>Finger painting</li>
				<li>Painting</li>
				<li>Photography</li>
				<li>Pottery</li>
				<li>Sculpting</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>
				What is music therapy?
			</h4>
			<p id="speci2">
				Music therapy is an evidence-based form of treatment that uses music interventions to help people accomplish their therapy goals. Performed by certified therapists, music therapy was designed to address a range of mental, physical, cognitive, and social issues that can impact a person’s mental health. 

Music therapy might look a little different for each person, but it usually involves some combination of active and receptive techniques. Active music therapy is when a person is actually creating music—this could be composing, singing, chanting, or playing an instrument. Receptive techniques tend to focus on listening or responding to music, such as a discussion about the lyrics to a song or dancing to a beat.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h5>Benefits of art and music therapy
			</h5>
			<p id="specia2">
				Art and music therapies are less about creating a masterpiece and more about the process of self-discovery and healing. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, which allows each person to discover what works for them. 

Art and music therapies were designed to help improve a person’s functioning and overall quality of life. Other benefits of using artistic mediums for therapy include:
<ul>
	<li>Improving mental health
	</li>
	<li>Decreasing symptoms of mental or physical illness
	</li>
	<li>Enhancing ability to recognize and cope with a variety of symptoms
	</li>
	<li>Providing an escape from negative thoughts or cravings 
	</li>
	<li>Stimulating cognitive function
	</li>
	<li>Improving communication skills and the ability to express oneself
	</li>
	<li>Addressing past traumas and in a safe environment
	</li>
	<li>Changing unhealthy behaviors 
	</li>
