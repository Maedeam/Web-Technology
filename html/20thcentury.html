				<h2>Music Therapy Perspectives</h2>
				<br />
				<p class="content">
					Music therapy, an allied health profession,
					<q>
						is the clinical and evidence-based use of music
						interventions to accomplish individualized goals within
						a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed
						professional who has completed an approved music therapy
						program.
					</q>
					It is also a vocation, involving a deep commitment to music
					and the desire to use it as a medium to help others.
					Although music therapy has only been established as a
					profession relatively recently, the connection between music
					and therapy is not new Music therapy is a broad field. Music
					therapists use music-based experiences to address client
					needs in one or more domains of human functioning:
					cognitive, academic, emotional/psychological; behavioral;
					communication; social; physiological (sensory, motor, pain,
					neurological and other physical systems), spiritual,
					aesthetics.Music experiences are strategically designed to
					use the elements of music for therapeutic effects, including
					melody, harmony, key, mode, meter, rhythm, pitch/range,
					duration, timbre, form, texture, and instrumentation.Some
					common music therapy practices include developmental work
					(communication, motor skills, etc.) with individuals with
					special needs, songwriting and listening in reminiscence,
					orientation work with the elderly, processing and relaxation
					work, and rhythmic entrainment for physical rehabilitation
					in stroke survivors. Music therapy is used in medical
					hospitals, cancer centers, schools, alcohol and drug
					recovery programs, psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes, and
					correctional facilities.There is a broad qualitative and
					quantitative research literature base for music therapy.
					Music therapy is distinctive from Musopathy, which relies on
					a more generic and non-cultural approach based on neural,
					physical, and other responses to the fundamental aspects of
					sound.Evidence suggests that music therapy is beneficial for
					all individuals, both physically and mentally. Benefits of
					music therapy include improved heart rate, reduced anxiety,
					stimulation of the brain, and improved learning.Music
					therapists use their techniques to help their patients in
					many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after
					surgeries to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease.
					One study found that children who listened to music while
					having an IV inserted into their arms showed less distress
					and felt less pain than the children who did not listen to
					music while having an IV inserted.Studies on patients
					diagnosed with mental health disorders such as anxiety,
					depression, and schizophrenia have shown a visible
					improvement in their mental health after music therapy.The
					National Institute for Health and Care Excellence have
					claimed that music therapy is an effective method in helping
					individuals experiencing mental health issues, and more
					should be done to offer those in need this type of help.

				<h2>Use with medical disorders</h2>
				<p class="content">
					Music can both motivate and provide a sense of
					distraction.Rhythmic stimuli has been found to help balance
					training for those with a brain injury.Singing is a form of
					rehabilitation for neurological impairments. Neurological
					impairments following a brain injury can be in the form of
					apraxia â€“ loss to perform purposeful movements, dysarthria,
					muscle control disturbances (due to damage of the central
					nervous system), aphasia (defect in expression causing
					distorted speech), or language comprehension. Singing
					training has been found to improve lung, speech clarity, and
					coordination of speech muscles, thus, accelerating
					rehabilitation of such neurological impairments. For
					example, melodic intonation therapy is the practice of
					communicating with others by singing to enhance speech or
					increase speech production by promoting socialization, and
					emotional expression.

						<h2>Autism</h2>
						<p>
							Music has played an important role in the research
							of dealing with autism, mainly in diagnosis,
							therapy, and behavioral abilities according to a
							scientific article written by Thenille Braun Janzen
							and Michael H. Thaut. This article concluded that
							music can help autistic patients hone their motor
							and attention skills as well as healthy
							neurodevelopment of socio-communication and
							interaction skills. Music therapy also resulted in
							positive improvement in selective attention, speech
							production, and language processing and acquisition
							in autistic patients Music therapy is thought to be
							helpful with autistic children by providing
							repetitive stimuli that aim to "teach" the brain
							other possible ways to respond that might be more
							useful as they grow older. Studies on the long term
							effects on music therapy in children with autism
							indicate many positive effects in children. Some of
							these effects include increased communication
							skills, decreased stress, increased social
							interaction, and the ability to be creative and to
							express themselves. Music therapy not only benefits
							the child with autism, but the family as a whole.
							Many of the mothers of children with autism claim
							that music therapy sessions have allowed their child
							to interact more with the family and the world.
							Music therapy is also beneficial in that it gives
							children an outlet to use outside of the sessions.
							Many children after participating in music therapy
							want to keep making music long after the sessions
							end.

						<h2>Heart disease</h2>
						<p>
							According to a 2013 Cochrane review, listening to
							music may improve heart rate, respiratory rate, and
							blood pressure in those with coronary heart disease
							(CHD).Furthermore, research has been done on
							children with simple congenital heart disease. In a
							study conducted in Fuzhou, China, it was discovered
							that preoperative music therapy lead to a decrease
							in anxiety around surgery, reduced the psychological
							impact on the patient, stabilized vital signs, and
							improved patient cooperation with anesthesia
							induction.

						<h2>Stroke</h2>
						<p>
							Music is useful in the recovery of motor skills. In
							a study on stroke patients in the recovery phase,
							music therapy was used in addition to other types of
							therapy in one group of patients and was not used in
							the other group. While both groups showed an
							increase in their standard of living, the group that
							used the music therapy showed more of an increase
							than the group that didn't. The group that used
							music therapy also showed less anxiousness and
							depression after the therapy. While both groups
							showed an increase in the strength of their
							non-dominant hands, the group with music therapy
							showed a much larger increase. Also, patients that
							underwent music therapy were able to regulate their
							emotions better and showed increased communication
							as a whole.

						<h2>Dementia</h2>
						<p>
							Like many of the other disorders mentioned, some of
							the most common significant effects of the disorder
							can be seen in social behaviors, leading to
							improvements in interaction, conversation, and other
							such skills. A study of over 330 subjects showed
							that music therapy produces highly significant
							improvements in social behaviors, overt behaviors
							like wandering and restlessness, reductions in
							agitated behaviors, and improvements to cognitive
							defects, measured with reality orientation and face
							recognition tests. The effectiveness of the
							treatment seems to be strongly dependent on the
							patient and the quality and length of treatment. A
							group of adults with dementia participated in group
							music therapy.In the group, these adults engaged in
							singing, drumming, improvisation, and movement. Each
							of these activities engaged the adults in different
							ways. The singing aided with memory, as these adults
							improved memorization skills in by taking out
							specific words in the chorus of a song and by
							repeating phrases back to the music therapist when
							the therapist sang a phrase of a song to them.
							Drumming led to increased socialization of the
							group, as it allowed the patients collaborate to
							create particular rhythms. Improvisation allowed the
							patients to get out of their comfort zone and taught
							them how to better deal with anxiety. Lastly,
							movement with either one arm or two increased social
							interaction between the patients.Another meta-study
							examined the proposed neurological mechanisms behind
							music therapy's effects on these patients[citation
							needed]. Many authors suspect that music has a
							soothing effect on the patient by affecting how
							noise is perceived: music renders noise familiar, or
							buffers the patient from overwhelming or extraneous
							noise in their environment. Others suggest that
							music serves as a sort of mediator for social
							interactions, providing a vessel through which to
							interact with others without requiring much
							cognitive load.

						<h2>Aphasia</h2>
						<p>
							Broca's aphasia, or non-fluent aphasia, is a
							language disorder caused by damage to Broca's area
							and surrounding regions in the left frontal
							lobe.Those with non-fluent aphasia are able to
							understand language fairly well, but they struggle
							with language production and syntax.Neurologist
							Oliver Sacks, studied neurological oddities in
							people, trying to understand how the brain works. He
							concluded that people with some type of frontal lobe
							damage often produced not only severe difficulties
							with expressive language (aphasia) but a strange
							access of musicality with incessant whistling,
							singing and a passionate interest in music.For him,
							this was an example of normally suppressed brain
							functions being released by damage to others. Sacks
							had a genuine interest in trying to help people
							affected with neurological disorders and other
							phenomena associated with music, and how it can
							provide access to otherwise unreachable emotional
							states, revivify neurological avenues that have been
							frozen, evoke memories of earlier, lost events or
							states of being and attempts to bring those with
							neurological disorders back to a time when the world
							was much richer for them. He was a firm believer
							that music has the power to heal. Melodic intonation
							therapy (MIT), developed in 1973 by neurological
							researchers Sparks, Helm, and Albert, is a method
							used by music therapists and speechâ€“language
							pathologists to help people with communication
							disorders caused by damage to the left hemisphere of
							the brain by engaging the singing abilities and
							possibly engaging language-capable regions in the
							undamaged right hemisphere. While unable to speak
							fluently, patients with non-fluent aphasia are often
							able to sing words, phrases, and even sentences they
							cannot express otherwise.MIT harnesses the singing
							ability of patients with non-fluent aphasia as a
							means to improve their communication. Although its
							exact nature depends on the therapist, in general
							MIT relies on the use of intonation (the rising and
							falling of the voice) and rhythm (beat/speed) to
							train patients to produce phrases verbally.In MIT,
							common words and phrases are turned into melodic
							phrases, generally starting with two step sing-song
							patterns and eventually emulating typical speech
							intonation and rhythmic patterns.A therapist will
							usually begin by introducing an intonation to their
							patient through humming. They will accompany this
							humming with a rhythm produced by the tapping of the
							left hand.At the same time, the therapist will
							introduce a visual stimuli of the written phrase to
							be learned.The therapist then sings the phrase with
							the patient, and ideally the patient is eventually
							able to sing the phrase on their own.With much
							repetition and through a process of
							<q>inner-rehearsal</q>
							(practicing internally hearing one's voice singing),
							a patient may eventually be able to produce the
							phrase verbally without singing.As the patient
							advances in therapy, the procedure can be adapted to
							give them more autonomy and to teach them more
							complex phrases.Through the use of MIT, a non-fluent
							aphasic patient can be taught numerous phrases which
							aid them to communicate and function during daily
							life. The mechanisms of this success are yet to be
							fully understood. It is commonly agreed that while
							speech is lateralized mostly to the left hemisphere
							(for right-handed and most left-handed individuals),
							some speech functionality is also distributed in the
							right hemisphere.MIT is thought to stimulate these
							right language areas through the activation of music
							processing areas also in the right hemisphere
							Similarly, the rhythmic tapping of the left hand
							stimulates the right sensorimotor cortex to further
							engage the right hemisphere in language production.
							Overall, by stimulating the right hemisphere during
							language tasks, therapists hope to decrease
							dependence on the left hemisphere for language
							production.While results are somewhat contradictory,
							studies have in fact found increased right
							hemispheric activation in non-fluent aphasic
							patients after MIT.This change in activation has
							been interpreted as evidence of decreased dependence
							on the left hemisphere.There is debate, however, as
							to whether changes in right hemispheric activation
							are part of the therapeutic process during/after
							MIT, or are simply a side effect of non-fluent
							aphasia.In hopes of making MIT more effective,
							researchers are continually studying the mechanisms
							of MIT and non-fluent aphasia.

				<h2>Cultural aspects</h2>
				<p>
					Through the ages music has been an integral component of
					rituals, ceremonies, healing practices, and spiritual and
					cultural traditions.Further, Michael Bakan, author of World
					Music: Traditions and Transformations, states that
					<q>
						Music is a mode of cultural production and can reveal
						much about how the culture works
					</q>
					,something ethnomusicologists study.The 21st century is a
					culturally pluralistic world. In some countries, such as the
					United States, an individual may have multiple cultural
					identities that are quite different from the music
					therapist's. These include race; ethnicity, culture, and/or
					heritage; religion; sex; ability/disability; education; or
					socioeconomic status.Music therapists strive to achieve
					multicultural competence through a lifelong journey of
					formal and informal education and self-reflection.
					Multicultural therapy
					<q>
						uses modalities and defines goals consistent with the
						life experiences and cultural values of clients
					</q>
					rather than basing therapy on the therapist's worldview or
					the dominant culture's norms.Empathy in general is an
					important aspect of any mental health practitioner and the
					same is true for music therapists, as is multicultural
					awareness. It is the added complexity to cultural empathy
					that comes from adding music that provides both the greater
					risk and potential to provide exceptional culturally
					sensitive therapy (Valentino, 2006). An extensive knowledge
					of a culture is really needed to provide this effective
					treatment as providing culturally sensitive music therapy
					goes beyond knowing the language of speech, the country, or
					even some background about the culture. Simply choosing
					music that is from the same country of origin or that has
					the same spoken language is not effective for providing
					music therapy as music genres vary as do the messages each
					piece of music sends. Also, different cultures view and use
					music in various ways and may not always be the same as how
					the therapist views and uses music. Melody Schwantes and her
					colleagues wrote an article that describes the effective use
					of the Mexican
					<q>corrido</q>
					in a bereavement group of Mexican migrant farm workers
					(Schwantes, Wigram, Lipscomb & Richards, 2011). This support
					group was dealing with the loss of two of their coworkers
					after an accident they were in and so the corrido, a song
					form traditionally used for telling stories of the deceased.
					An important element that was also mentioned was that
					songwriting has shown to be a large cultural artifact in
					many cultures, and that there are many subtle messages and
					thoughts provided in songs that would otherwise be hard to
					identify. Lastly, the authors of this study stated that
					Given the position and importance of songs in all cultures,
					the example in this therapeutic process demonstrates the
					powerful nature of lyrics and music to contain and express
					difficult and often unspoken feelings.

				<h2>Use with children</h2>
				<p>
					Music therapy may be used with adolescent populations to
					treat disorders usually diagnosed in adolescence, such as
					mood/anxiety disorders and eating disorders, or
					inappropriate behaviors, including suicide attempts,
					withdrawal from family, social isolation from peers,
					aggression, running away, and substance abuse. Goals in
					treating adolescents with music therapy, especially for
					those at high risk, often include increased recognition and
					awareness of emotions and moods, improved decision-making
					skills, opportunities for creative self expression,
					decreased anxiety, increased self-confidence, improved
					self-esteem, and better listening skills.Music therapy has
					multiple benefits that contribute to the maintenance of
					health and the drive toward rehabilitation for children.
					Advanced technology that can monitor cortical activity
					offers a look at how music engages and produces changes in
					the brain during the perception and production of musical
					stimuli. Music therapy, when used with other rehabilitation
					methods, has increased the success rate of sensorimotor,
					cognitive, and communicative rehabilitation.
